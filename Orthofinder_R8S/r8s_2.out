Branch lengths assumed to be in units of numbers of substitutions per site
Number of sites in sequences set to 350351
All branch lengths multipled by the 350351 sites in the sequence
Branch lengths rounded to nearest integer
(This may not be a good idea when using CALIBRATE on ultrametric user supplied input trees. Use ROUND=NO then)
